	description =  A larger variant of the T404 D-2. The T404 D-3 Modular Truss is the pinnacle of spacecraft design. Features a large industrial grade light (spotlight), incredible structural strength, and 375 units of electric charge. Good for when a normal hard point wonâ€™t do or when you need to make room for something awkward.
