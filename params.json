Copy the folder “kerbodynePlus” to your GameData folder.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have KSP 1.05 or higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n# About\r\n\r\nKerbodyne Plus is an end-game parts pack for the game Kerbal Space Program. \r\n\r\nYou have downloaded a development version. Use at your own peril :/\r\n\r\n[link](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/)\r\n\r\n##Project Goals\r\n* Provide optimized parts for large construction\r\n* Improve end-game play\r\n* Provide beautifully designed parts\r\n* Conform to modular design practices (shared materials, uniform dimensions, etc)\r\n* Combine parts to reduce part count\r\n* Keep designs grounded in reality (or at worst near-future)\r\n* Remain mod agnostic (Kerbodyne Plus does not support or hinder other mods)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\n## Current Team\r\n\r\n* Bonus Eventus — 3d Modeling, CFG design, Project Lead\r\n\r\n## Special thanks\r\n\r\n* This mod would not exist without the work of my predecessors nil2work, Bac9, and Roverdude as well as everyone at the addon dev KSP forum. \r\n\r\n* I’d also like to thank all the users of Kerbodyne Plus. This is my first mod, so I’ve had to learn quite a lot as the project progressed. Thanks for being patient!\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis work and all its files is shared under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license.
